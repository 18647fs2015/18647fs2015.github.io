This course focuses on the systems architecture aspects of building scalable
systems from lots of embedded devices that connect to the cloud.
We will address back-end server architectures for such systems, protocols and
abstraction techniques that allow systems to be made of heterogeneous devices,
authentication & security, fault tolerance & resilience to failure,
semi-connectedness, performance issues, and distributed programming & sync.
As part of the course, we will build some scalable systems, with either real
or artificial load.
