Lab 1 is underway! The full instructions can be found [here](/lab1).

Make sure to complete the following as soon as possible: Send
me your github account name so that you have a repository and access to the server.

Once I have added your account, you can also login to our testbed infrastructure:

[http://10.0.13.179:8080/](http://10.0.13.179:8080/)

This is the server substituting the cloud in our scenario. It is only reachable
from the CMU SV network so unless you do some VPN trickery, you will only be able to
access it on campus. You can login with your GitHub account and then test sending
and receiving MIDI events. If you encounter any problems or bugs, please let us know!

## Tutorials

Yesterday a couple of students also asked for resources to ramp up on JavaScript
and Node.js. There are many, many resources available on the web, but the
following two I'd recommend the most:

* [A re-introduction to JavaScript by Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)
* [Online Workshops by NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers)
